# Gno Native Kit

Gno Native Kit is a framework that allows developers to build and port gno.land (d)apps written in the (d)app's native language.

Current Gno (d)apps run on desktop/laptop computers which have Go installed. To run on mobile, the (d)app would need to bundle the Go runtime, which is complicated for most developers.

However, Gno Native Kit helps bypass this complexity by using gRPC to make [calls to the Gno core API](https://buf.build/gnolang/gnonative/docs/main:land.gno.gnonative.v1) and access the blockchain's realm functions on a remote Gno.land node.
These API calls are a programming language-independent wrapper on top of the core supported APIs like [gnoclient](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/tree/master/gno.land/pkg/gnoclient) and [crypto/keys](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/tree/master/tm2/pkg/crypto/keys).

Watch [this Gno Native Kit tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1HLyQDHGQ0) to easily get started on building and bringing your (d)apps to mobile and desktop.

## Build instructions

### Install prerequisites for macOS 13

(If you are on Ubuntu, see the next section to install prerequisites.)

Install Xcode. To install the Command Line Developer Tools, in a terminal enter:

    xcode-select --install

After the Developer Tools are installed, we need to make sure it is updated. In
System Preferences, click Software Update and update it if needed.

To install asdf using brew, follow instructions at https://asdf-vm.com . In short,
first install brew following the instructions at https://brew.sh . Then, in
a terminal enter:

    brew install asdf gnu-tar gpg jq

If your terminal is zsh, enter:

    echo -e "\n. $(brew --prefix asdf)/libexec/asdf.sh" >> ${ZDOTDIR:-~}/.zshrc

If your terminal is bash, enter:

    echo -e "\n. \"$(brew --prefix asdf)/libexec/asdf.sh\"" >> ~/.bash_profile

Start a new terminal to get the changes to the environment.

(optional) To install Android Studio, download and install the latest
android-studio-{version}-mac.dmg from https://developer.android.com/studio .
(Tested with Jellyfish 2023.3.1 .)

### Install prerequisites for Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04 and 24.04

To install asdf, follow instructions at https://asdf-vm.com . In short, in
a terminal enter:

    sudo apt install curl git make
    git clone https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf.git ~/.asdf
    echo '. "$HOME/.asdf/asdf.sh"' >> ~/.profile
    source ~/.profile

Start a new terminal to get the changes to the environment.

(optional) To install Android Studio, download the latest
android-studio-{version}-linux.tar.gz from
https://developer.android.com/studio . (Tested with Jellyfish 2023.3.1 .)
In a terminal, enter the following with the correct {version}:

    sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf android-studio-{version}-linux.tar.gz

To launch Android Studio, in a terminal enter:

    /usr/local/android-studio/bin/studio.sh &

### Get a copy of the repo

```console
git clone https://github.com/gnolang/gnonative
cd gnonative
```

### Build for Android

#### Set up the Android NDK

-   Launch Android Studio and accept the default startup options. Create a new
    default project (so that we get the main screen).
-   On the Tools menu, open the SDK Manager.
-   In the "SDK Tools" tab, click "Show Package Details". Expand
    "NDK (Side by side)" and check "23.1.7779620".
-   Click OK to install and close the SDK Manager.

#### Install the tools with asdf (only need to do once)

(If not building for iOS, edit the file `.tool-versions` and remove the unneeded lines for `ruby` and `cocoapods`.)

```console
make asdf.install_tools
```

#### Build the Go code as a library

```console
make framework.android
```

#### Start metro

```console
cd examples/js/react-native/gnoboard
npm start
```

#### Connect your Android phone/emulator and bind its port to metro

You can either connect an Android phone via USB cable, or launch an emulator device from Android Studio.

##### Real device

Connect your device and bind the port to metro:

```console
cd examples/js/react-native/gnoboard
make android.reverse_tcp
```

##### Emulator device

You can either run Android Studio and open the Android project in `examples/js/react-native/gnoboard/android`.
If you prefer the CLI option:

```console
android-studio ./android
```

Once done, bind the port to metro:

```console
make android.reverse_tcp
```

#### Build with Android Studio

Open Android Studio and open the current Android project if it's not already done.
Select the right device in the device list. Open the `Run` menu, and select `Run app`.

### Build for iOS

#### Install the tools with asdf (only need to do once)

```console
make asdf.install_tools
```

If you get an error like "https://github.com/CocoaPods/CLAide.git (at master@97b765e) is not yet checked out" then reinstall cocoapods like this:

```console
asdf uninstall cocoapods
make asdf.install_tools
```

#### Build the Go code as a library

```console
make framework.ios
```

#### Start metro

```console
cd examples/js/react-native/gnoboard
npm start
```

#### Open Xcode and connect your iOS device

Open Xcode and open the GnoBoard Xcode workspace: `examples/js/react-native/gnoboard/ios/gnoboard.xcworkspace`
You can either connect an iOS phone via USB cable, or launch an emulator device from Xcode.
See more: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/running-your-app-in-simulator-or-on-a-device

#### Select a developer certificate

In Xcode, double click on gnoboard project on the left pane, go to the `Signing & Capabilities` pane.
In the `Signing` section, select your `team` certificate.

#### Build with Xcode

Select the right device in the device list. Open the `Product` menu, and select `Run`.
